## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Chuck Schooley. I am a student at The University of Maine Augusta studying for BS in Computer Information Systems and plan to change focus to major in Cybersecurity.

My Maine interests are in Red Team Operations, Ethical Hacking, Bug Bounty, Software Engineering, and Web Dev. My number one priority is learning to code and be well rounded and versed in the tools of the trade. It is a passion for me not a hobby although it takes up that space as well! I am currently learning Python, HTML5, React.js, JS, CSS, GO, and on the side for fun Nim and Rust.

I am just learning all the different paths within the community of programmers and coders but it is all exciting and I am looking forward to learning as much as possible from the community and my peers as well as contibuting and volunteering wherever possible. I love taking on challenges and solving problems and constructive criticism is much accepted if others would like to give it.

Skills: My skills are spread out and unrefined as I have just started learning but I take in the most when it is hands on and would like to collaborate wherever I can. I would say that my main focus on skills I would like to hone most are Ethical Hacking, Bug Bounty, Red Team/Purple Team. I am Python based however I am more drawn to the lower level languages where I have more control over the machine and can pay attention to details and memory management etc.
